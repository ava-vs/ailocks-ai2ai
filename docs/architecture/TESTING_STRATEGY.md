# Automated Testing Strategy for AI Agents

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Ailocks: Ai2Ai Network project, with a specific focus on how AI agents should approach testing when making changes to the codebase. Proper testing is critical to maintaining the integrity and functionality of the platform as it evolves.

## Test Types

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components, functions, or classes in isolation.

**Framework:** Jest

**Location:** `/tests/unit/`

**When to run:** After any code change, before committing

**How AI agents should use them:**
- AI agents must run relevant unit tests after modifying any business logic
- If modifying existing functionality, ensure existing tests continue to pass
- When adding new functionality, create corresponding unit tests
- Pay special attention to edge cases and error handling

Example command for running unit tests:
```bash
npm run test:unit
```

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work together correctly.

**Framework:** Jest + Supertest

**Location:** `/tests/integration/`

**When to run:** After completing feature implementation that spans multiple components

**How AI agents should use them:**
- Run integration tests after changes that affect multiple components
- Create new integration tests when adding features that span multiple components
- Focus on testing API endpoints, database interactions, and service integrations
- Verify that error handling works across component boundaries

Example command for running integration tests:
```bash
npm run test:integration
```

### 3. End-to-End Tests

E2E tests simulate user interactions and test the application from a user's perspective.

**Framework:** Playwright

**Location:** `/tests/e2e/`

**When to run:** Before submitting a pull request or after completing a significant feature

**How AI agents should use them:**
- Run the full E2E test suite before submitting completed work
- Create new E2E tests for new user-facing features
- Test critical user flows, especially those involving AI interactions
- Include tests for geographic features across different regions

Example command for running E2E tests:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## AI Agent Testing Protocol

### Pre-Implementation Testing

Before making changes, AI agents should:

1. Identify which tests cover the areas they plan to modify
2. Run these tests to establish a baseline
3. Document the current test coverage and any failing tests

Example:
```bash
npm run test:coverage -- --collectCoverageFrom=src/modules/ailock/**/*.ts
```

### During Implementation

While implementing changes, AI agents should:

1. Write tests in parallel with code changes (Test-Driven Development when possible)
2. Run unit tests frequently to catch issues early
3. Keep track of which tests need to be updated due to interface changes

### Post-Implementation Testing

After completing changes, AI agents must:

1. Run the full test suite for the affected areas
2. Run integration tests for connected components
3. Run relevant E2E tests for user-facing changes
4. Document test results and any test improvements made
5. Ensure test coverage has not decreased

## Automated Testing in CI/CD

AI agents should be aware of how tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline:

1. GitHub Actions automatically runs tests on pull requests
2. Tests must pass before code can be merged
3. Test coverage reports are generated and reviewed
4. Performance benchmarks are evaluated against baseline

### GitHub Actions Configuration

The project uses the following GitHub Actions workflows for testing:

- `unit-tests.yml`: Runs unit tests
- `integration-tests.yml`: Runs integration tests
- `e2e-tests.yml`: Runs end-to-end tests
- `coverage-report.yml`: Generates and publishes test coverage reports

## Testing Geographic Features

The Ailocks platform relies heavily on geographic features, which require special testing approaches:

1. Mock location data for various global regions
2. Test with different timezones and locales
3. Verify geo-aware functions with sample coordinates
4. Test edge cases like international date line, polar regions

Example test setup for geographic testing:
```typescript
// Example geographic test setup
describe('Geographic Intent Matching', () => {
  const testLocations = [
    { lat: 35.6812, lng: 139.7671, region: 'Tokyo' },    // Tokyo
    { lat: 40.7128, lng: -74.0060, region: 'New York' }, // New York
    { lat: -33.8688, lng: 151.2093, region: 'Sydney' },  // Sydney
    { lat: 51.5074, lng: -0.1278, region: 'London' }     // London
  ];

  testLocations.forEach(location => {
    it(`should find nearby agents in ${location.region}`, async () => {
      // Test code using location
    });
  });
});
```

## Testing Voice Agent Features

For voice agent features, special testing is required:

1. Mock ElevenLabs API responses
2. Test transcription accuracy with sample audio files
3. Verify voice command recognition
4. Test multilingual voice capabilities

## Test Data Management

AI agents should follow these practices for test data:

1. Use factory functions to generate test data
2. Never use production data in tests
3. Reset the test database before each test suite
4. Use static seed data for consistent test results

Example of a test data factory:
```typescript
// User factory example
export function createTestUser(overrides = {}) {
  return {
    id: uuidv4(),
    username: `test-user-${Date.now()}`,
    email: `test-${Date.now()}@example.com`,
    ailock: {
      level: 1,
      xp: 0,
      skills: []
    },
    ...overrides
  };
}
```

## AI-specific Testing Requirements

When AI agents implement or modify AI capabilities, they should:

1. Test with various AI model responses (success, failure, edge cases)
2. Mock AI service API calls to ensure consistent test results
3. Test fallback mechanisms for when primary AI services fail
4. Verify cost optimization logic is working correctly
5. Test with a variety of prompt formats and complexities

Example of mocking AI model responses:
```typescript
// Example mock for OpenAI API
jest.mock('openai', () => ({
  OpenAI: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
    chat: {
      completions: {
        create: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
          choices: [{
            message: {
              content: 'Mocked AI response'
            }
          }]
        })
      }
    }
  }))
}));
```

## Test Documentation

AI agents must document all test-related activities:

1. Document test coverage for new features
2. Explain testing strategy for complex components
3. Document any test limitations or special considerations
4. Update test documentation when making significant changes to test approach

## Continuous Improvement

AI agents should continuously improve the testing process:

1. Identify gaps in test coverage
2. Suggest improvements to test infrastructure
3. Implement more efficient testing patterns
4. Optimize test speed without sacrificing quality
