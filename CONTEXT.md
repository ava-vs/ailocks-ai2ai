# Ailocks: Ai2Ai Network Terminology

## Key Concepts

### Ailock
A personal AI assistant for users, capable of evolving, acquiring skills, and interacting with other Ailocks in the network. Ailocks grow through an XP-based leveling system and can specialize in different skill branches.

### Smart Chain
An automatically generated sequence of steps to complete a complex task, where each step can be performed by the most suitable agent. Smart Chains decompose complex intents into manageable, distributed sub-tasks.

### Intent
A user request to perform a specific task, which can be decomposed into a Smart Chain. Intents contain information about the requester, task details, location context, and other metadata.

### Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocol
A protocol for communication between different AI agents, allowing them to delegate tasks and utilize specialized external skills. Based on Google's A2A Protocol for interoperability between agent ecosystems.

## Contexts

### User Context
- User account management
- Personal preferences and settings
- Interaction history and feedback
- Security and privacy settings
- Notification preferences

### Ailock Evolution Context
- XP and leveling system (20 levels with exponential growth)
- Skill tree with four branches:
  - Research: Capabilities for gathering and analyzing information
  - Collaboration: Abilities to work effectively with other agents
  - Efficiency: Optimizations for faster and more cost-effective processing
  - Convenience: Features that enhance user experience
- Gamification mechanics (achievements, challenges, rewards)

### Geographic Context
- Geolocation data and detection
- Regional specialization of agents
- Cultural adaptation mechanisms
- Location-based filtering and prioritization
- Weather and local service integration

### Collaboration Context
- Inter-Ailock communication protocols
- Rating and reputation system for agents
- Task distribution algorithms
- Consensus mechanisms for complex decisions
- Cross-platform collaboration standards

## Data Models

### User
- Basic profile information
- Authentication and authorization details
- Preferences and settings
- Subscription and payment information

### Ailock Profile
- Core attributes (level, XP, skill points)
- Unlocked skills and capabilities
- Evolution history
- Specialization metrics

### Intent
- Request details and parameters
- Geographic constraints
- Deadline and priority indicators
- Budget and resource constraints

### Smart Chain
- Component steps and dependencies
- Status tracking for each step
- Input/output specifications
- Performance metrics

## Technical Terminology

### Edge Functions
Serverless functions that run at the edge of the network (Netlify), providing geo-location detection, internationalization, and smart routing capabilities.

### AI Pipeline
The sequence of AI model processing steps, including model selection, prompt creation, response streaming, and post-processing.

### Embedding Service
A system using AI models to convert text into vector representations for semantic search and intent matching.

### Intent Tokenization
The potential representation of intents as unique digital assets (e.g., NFTs), enabling new economic models, liquidity for complex tasks, and enhanced escrow mechanisms.
